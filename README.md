## Wikipedia Search Extension Helper
This is a basic extension that adds a context menu for highlighted text to search in wikepdia and additionally adds a popup menu for wikipedia searching. A small project made in an hour or two for fun (I have not made a chrome extension before). The results are opened within a new tab. Published to google extension store, there are probably better extensions that do the same thing.
